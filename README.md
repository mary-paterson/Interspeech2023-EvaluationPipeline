# A Pipeline to Evaluate the Effects of Noise on Machine Learning Detection of Laryngeal Cancer

This work has been accepted into Interspeech 2023. The full paper can be found [here](https://www.google.com).

In this paper we describe a pipeline for the evaluation of classification models in the presence of noise. We demonstrate this pipeline using four classification models and three denoising techniques. For these experiments we use the Saarbruecken Voice Database (found [here](https://stimmdatenbank.coli.uni-saarland.de/help_en.php4#menu)). 

Figure 2 can be generated using the notebook titled 'AccuracyPerNoise'
Figure 3 can be generated using the notebook titled 'CompareDenoising'
